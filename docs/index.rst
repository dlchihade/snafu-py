SNAFU: The Semantic Network and Fluency Utility
===============================================

What is SNAFU?
--------------

The semantic fluency task is frequently used in psychology by both researchers and clinicians. SNAFU is a tool that helps you analyze fluency data. It can help with:

- Counting cluster switches and cluster sizes
- Counting perseverations
- Detecting intrusions
- Calculating average age-of-acquisition and word frequency
- ...more!

SNAFU also implements multiple network estimation methods which allow you to perform network analysis on your data (see Zemla & Austerweil, 2018). These methods include:

- U-INVITE networks
- Pathfinder networks
- Correlation-based networks
- Naive random walk network
- Conceptual networks
- First Edge networks

How do I use SNAFU?
-------------------

SNAFU can be used as a Python library or as a stand-alone GUI.  
The Python library is available at:

`https://github.com/AusterweilLab/snafu-py <https://github.com/AusterweilLab/snafu-py>`_

To install directly:

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/AusterweilLab/snafu-py

The GitHub repository contains several demo files, and a tutorial covering some basic usage is available in Zemla et al., 2020.

If you plan to use the ``correlationBasedNetwork()`` function, install `planarity` separately:

::

    pip install planarity

A graphical front-end is also available, though it contains fewer features than the Python library. Download it here:

**macOS**

- `SNAFU 2.4.1 for macOS (latest version) <https://alab.psych.wisc.edu/snafu/snafu-2.4.1-mac-x64.dmg>`_

**Windows**

- `SNAFU 2.2.0 for Windows <https://alab.psych.wisc.edu/snafu/snafu-2.2.0-win-x64.zip>`_
